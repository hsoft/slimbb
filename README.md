# slimbb

*[djangobb][djangobb] with cruft removed.*

slimbb is a fork of [djangobb][djangobb] which, at the time of the fork, was slowly falling into
abandon. To keep my own forum instance afloat and to minimize my own maintenance burden, I
proceeded to remove all the useless (to me) cruft that had accumulated in djangobb over the years.

That might seem petty, but all those cute features ended up amounting to significant complexity
(and thus maintenance burden).

This library will be kept in check, feature-wise. It will not go over the state of "like a
mailing list, but searchable and usable through a web browser". Everything else is cut off.
